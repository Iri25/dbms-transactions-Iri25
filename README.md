Database Management Systems

Implement the following scenarios for your own database:

- Create a stored procedure that inserts data for entities that are in an m-n relationship.
If an insertion operation fails, the entire procedure must be rolled back stored.
- Create a stored procedure that inserts data for entities that are in an m-n relationship.
If an insert operation fails you will need to keep as much of it as possible what has changed so far. For example, if you try to insert a book and its authors, and the authors have been successfully inserted but a problem arises at book insertion, then roll back to book insertion but its authors to remains in the database. 

Create 4 scenarios that reproduce the following situations generated by the concurrent execution: 
- dirty reads
- non-repeatable reads
- phantom reads
- deadlock. 

You can implement these scenarios both as stored procedures and as independent queries. Also, for each of the scenarios created, find solutions to solve / avoid these situations.
